# Spotify Clone — Web Player UI

A minimal Spotify-like web player UI built with plain HTML and CSS. This project demonstrates layout, responsive controls, and a simple music player footer using static assets.

## Features
- Clean dark UI similar to Spotify's web player
- Responsive layout with sidebar, main content, and fixed music player
- Custom styled range inputs for playback and volume
- Static demo content using local assets

## Files
- [index.html](index.html) — main markup for the UI
- [style.css](style.css) — all styles and responsive rules
- [assets/](assets/) — images and icons used by the UI

## Usage
1. Open [index.html](index.html) in a browser (double-click or use "Open File").
2. Or serve the folder with a simple HTTP server (recommended for consistent font/icon loading):
   - Python 3: `python -m http.server`
   - Node (http-server): `npx http-server`

## Notes
- This is a static UI mock — no audio playback logic is included.
- Replace images in [assets/](assets/) to customize the look.
